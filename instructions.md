### EBlock Test

Using the provided JSON file ([payload.json]('./payload.json')), create a React application based on the linked mock-up below.

Feel free to use something like [Create React app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) to get started.

##### API Documentation

The data comes back in the following format: `[payload] -> "data" -> "lanes"`

The lanes object will be returned as an array, use this to populate the lanes in the aforementioned design.

##### Requirements

Organization and clean, readable code is key.

ES6, SCSS, Redux are ubiquitous throughout our applications, so make sure to implement them.
